# PostgreSQL test configuration for lab environment
# Purpose: Learning and testing anxs.postgresql role behavior
# Security: Plaintext credentials - lab environment only, never use in production

# Test databases

postgresql_user_privileges:
  - name: testuser
    db: testdb

  - name: testuser
    db: backuptest

# Notes:
# - testdb: Primary database for general testing and queries
# - backuptest: Secondary database for pg_dump/pg_restore workflow testing
# - testuser: Has CREATEDB privilege for testing database operations
# - Plaintext password acceptable in isolated lab environment
# - This file will be replaced with SOPS-encrypted secrets when moving to production-like testing
